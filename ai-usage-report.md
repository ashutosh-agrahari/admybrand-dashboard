## AI Usage Report

### AI Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo)**: Used extensively for planning architecture, generating reusable UI components, providing code snippets, debugging integration issues, and crafting documentation.
- **v0.dev**: Utilized selectively for initial layout ideas and Tailwind-based component scaffolding.
- **GitHub Copilot (VS Code)**: Assisted with auto-suggestions and rapid prototyping during component development.

### Sample Prompts
1. "Build a responsive dashboard layout in Next.js 15 using Tailwind and dark mode support."
2. "Create a React component for a sortable campaign performance table with dummy data."
3. "Add a theme toggle using next-themes and Shadcn UI button."

### AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated (60%)**:
  - Initial boilerplate and folder structure.
  - Chart and card component templates.
  - Layout scaffolding with Tailwind CSS.
  - Troubleshooting missing module errors and configuration.

- **Manual Coding (40%)**:
  - Custom integration and styling of charts.
  - Final layout polish and responsive design tuning.
  - Component composition and state logic.
  - Refactoring auto-generated code for consistency and clarity.

### Customization & Adaptation
Every AI-generated block was reviewed and adjusted to match the branding, UX expectations, and functional requirements. Recharts integrations, theme support, and component layout required deeper customization for mobile responsiveness and interactivity. The result is a clean, modular, and production-ready UI foundationâ€”accelerated by AI but carefully shaped by developer intent.
